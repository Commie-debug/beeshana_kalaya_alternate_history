Sri Lanka, officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is a presidential republic with a powerful president and a parliament with somewhat constrained authority. The President serves as both head of state and head of government, wielding substantial executive power, while Parliament is responsible for legislation but operates under considerable presidential influence.

The President, modelled after the French president is elected by a ranked choice vote. The presidential term lasts six years, and the President can be re-elected. The role of the president extends far beyond ceremonial dutiesâ€”the office possesses extensive governing powers including the authority to appoint the Prime Minister and Cabinet, dissolve Parliament at his discretion, and personally hold multiple ministerial portfolios. The President can govern through executive decree in many areas, bypassing Parliament and concentrating substantial decision-making authority in the presidency itself. The President also appoints provincial governors who represent the central government's authority in the regions.

Parliament consists of 196 members elected through a system of proportional representation, giving parties seats roughly proportional to their vote share in each electoral district. Elections operate with voters casting their ballots in multi-member electoral districts that correspond to the country's administrative districts. Parliamentary terms last six years unless dissolved earlier by the President. Parliament is responsible for passing legislation and can scrutinise government actions, though its ability to check presidential power is limited by the powers of the president.

Sri Lanka is divided into nine provinces, each headed by a governor appointed by the President. Below the provincial level, the country is organised into multiple administrative districts, each managed under the central government's authority. At the local level, governance is conducted through Municipal Councils, Urban Councils, and Village/Town Councils, responsible for local administration and services.

= Timeline of the SLFP and Sri Lanka (until 1981)

**1946**: UNP founded by D.S Senanayke from a number of pro-dominion parties including the Ceylon National Congress, Sinhala Maha Sabha led by S.W.R.D Bandaranaike, and other right-leaning groups.

**1947**: Ceylon's first general strike in its history is put down bloodily by the colonial government.

**1947**: The UNP wins a plurality in Ceylon's first parliamentary elections, forming a coalition government with the ACTC. Senanayake becomes the first Prime Minister of Ceylon.

**1948**: Ceylon gains independence from the UK as a Dominion with the British monarch remaining as head of state.

**1948**: Ceylon Citizenship Act is enacted. This leads to the subeqsuent disenfranchisment and statelessness of Indian Tamils. 

**1953**: A hartal(civil disobediance campaign) is launched by the LSSP and other left wing parties in response to the UNP governments reversal of the rice subsidy and welfare programs. Prime minister Dudley Senanayake would resign.

**1956**: SLFP wins its first election on a socialist and sinhalese nationalist platform along with a coaltion consisting of smaller marxist parties. The SLFP and UNP campaigns deliberatly stirred ethnic tensions between Tamils and Sinhalese.

**1956**: Violence erupts in the Gal Oya valley between the former majority Tamils and Sinhalese who had been settled under a government scheme.

**1956**: Under the first SLFP government under S.W.R.D the Sinhala Only Act is enacted. The act replaced english with sinhala as the offical language of the country. This allowed more sinhalese to enter the civil service but also led to Tamils being disadvantaged forcing many to leave.

**1958**: Following the abrogation of a pact between S.W.R.D and ITAK(Tamil federal party) leader S.J.V Chelvanayakam which granted limited autonomy for Tamil areas, island wide riots broke out leading further distruct between Sinhalese and Tamils.

**1959/1960**: S.W.R.D Bandaranaike is assasinated by a buddhist monk. Following 2 chaotic elections between march and july 1960, S.W.R.D's widow Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike became the worlds first female head of state.

**1962**: Attempted miliary coup by christian officers leads to purges in the army, over the years the christian dominated army would be replaced by sinhalese.

**1964**: Mahaweli development program begins operations. 

**1964**: Srima-Shastri pact is signed providing thousands of state-less Indian Tamils with Indian citizenship allowing for their repatriation.

**1965**: JVP/Peoples Liberation Front is founded by Rohana Wijeweera as an underground organisation dedicated to revolutionary socialism.

**1970**: The SLFP and its "United Front" alliance with the LSSP and CPSL wins an overwhelming victory over the UNP. 

**1971**: The JVP launches an attempted insurection on the United Front government. Initally successful in holding large sections of the south, the small inexperienced army would crush the rebels in 2 months. Rohana himself would be imprisoned and the JVP would be banned.

**1977**: The UNP achieves a landslide in parliament. The loss demotes the SLFP to 3rd largest in parliament with the TULF becoming the largest opposition party. JR immedietly begins his plans to reshape the nation. The TULF's openly separatist program instigates anti-tamil pogroms around the island.

**1978**: Sri Lanka's 2nd and current republican constitution is introduced. It codifies the superiority of Buddhism and the Sinhala language with albiet limited provions for Tamil. JR assumes the new executive presidency holding vast powers with little no limits to it.

**Demographic Groups**

**Upper Class**: A small elite comprising industrialists, senior executives, and political leaders, often with inherited wealth and significant influence over economic and political spheres. They make up less than 1% of the population.

**Middle Class**: Professionals such as doctors, lawyers, teachers, and small business owners educated in former colonial schools, though economic changes began to strain their financial stability. They make up around 10% of the population.

**Working Class**: Manual laborers, factory workers, service employees and garment workers who often face low wages, limited job security, and challenging working conditions, leading to frequent labor unrest. They make up around 25% of the population

**Rural**: Primarily engaged in agriculture, mining and fishing, they face issues like land fragmentation and inadequate infrastructure, remaining largely disconnected from economic growth benefits. They make up around 35% of the population

**Unemployed**: High unemployment rates, especially among youth and recent graduates, have led to frustration and involvement in political movements seeking systemic change. They make up around 13% of the population

**Clergy**: Religious leaders across Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam who played influential roles in spiritual guidance, education, and community leadership, contributing to the moral and cultural fabric of society. They make up less than 1% of the population.

**Ethnic Groups**

**Sinhalese**: The islands largest ethnic group. Originally from North India, their ancestors migrated centuries ago. The Sinhalese speak Sinhala, an Indo-Aryan language. They are followers of Buddhism with a significant minority following Christianity. They generally live in the South, West and Central provinces with several communities and settlements in the North-East. Sinhalese parties have dominated the island's politics for decades and their politics is thus incredibly varied based on area, class, religon, etc split mainly between the UNP, SLFP, JVP, etc. They make up 73.95% of the population.

**Sri Lankan Tamil**: The islands second largest ethnic group. Part of the larger Tamil people originating from south India, their ancestors have lived on the island for just as long as the Sinhalese. They speak Tamil, a Dravidian language and are followers of Hinduism (Mostly Shaivism) with a large Christian minority. They dominate the North-East with communites in every major city. Traditionally, Tamils have supported pro-federal parties though some have began to drift towards seperatism and rebellion. They make up 12.71% of the population.

**Muslims**: The most genetically diverse group in Sri Lanka. From descendents of Yemenis, Malays, Tamils, Arabs, etc, They are united by their common religon of Islam. Speaking mostly Tamil, most can speak Sinhala as a second language. The Muslims are generally spread throughout the island with large pockets in major cities and the North-East. Despite maintaing a seperate cultural identity to other groups, they have generally supported Sinhalese parties like the SLFP and UNP. Recently there has been a shift towards Tamil parties or even a seperate political identity. They make up 7.05% of the population.

**Indian Tamil**: The youngest and more destitute of Sri Lanka. Descendent from lower caste Indian Tamil's brought by the british in the 19th century to farm first coffee, and then tea. They live mostly in the centre of the island in large slums close to their main occupation, the tea estates. Since independence the majority of them have no citizenship, with some being repatriated to India or Pakistan. The lack of franchisments has led them to suffer and politically, the few who can vote support the union and party CWC in the hopes of improving their lot. They make up around 5.51% of the population.

**Others**: This grouping consists of many groups such as the Burghers(Desendents of Europeans and theb locals), Kafirs(Desendents of African slaves and soliders brought by the Portugese), the ethnic Chinese and the indigeoneus "Vedda" whose history predates all other groups. The majority of this grouping reside in their own communities inside the major cities. This groups makes up around 0.78% of the population.

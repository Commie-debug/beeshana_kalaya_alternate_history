= Inter-Party Relationships

The <span style="color: #00008B;">**SLFP**</span> has never governed without a coalition to support it. In the past we have allied with nationalists, communists or even trotskyists. With our precarious position and the rapid changes to in the nation, we may need to form new bonds or strenghten our older alliances.

- @jvp: Strengthen our bonds with the revolutionary marxist <span style="color: #FF2226;">**JVP**</span>. This may be difficult knowing our shared histories.
- @tamil: Strengthen our bonds with the Tamil political parties like the <span style="color: #F7D917;">**TULF**</span> and <span style="color: #FDCC01;">**ACTC**</span>. The <span style="color: #0F52BA;">**Nationalists**</span> will not be happy with this.
- @communist: Work towards repairing relationships with the <span style="color: #65000B;">**CPSL**</span>, <span style="color: #A91101;">**LSSP**</span> and maybe even the smaller <span style="color: #FF8080;">**NSSP**</span>.
- @itamil: We could try forming a positive relationship with the Indian Tamil <span style="color: #E52B50;">**CWC**</span>. Once again our previous policy of repatriation will make this difficult.
- @muslim: The newly formed <span style="color: #2DCF3E;">**SLMC**</span> presents a new possible ally. At least we have generally been indifferent to Muslim concerns?
- @spd_alone: The SLFP can stand alone for now.

@spd_alone

Whether it is because we *cannot* or *will not*, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.

- @return: Continue...

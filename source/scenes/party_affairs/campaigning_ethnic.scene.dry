= Ethnic Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its voter base. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @sinhalese: Sinhalese are our largest voter base dominating the south and west. 
- @tamilsl: It is nessecary that we expand our support to the Tamils of the north-east. It may be difficult knowing our previous administrations actions.
- @tamilin: The Indian Tamils of the central province are small but their support may be needed to secure the tea plantations.
- @muslim: Muslims around the island lack a voice for their more proggressive atitudes, it can serve as well to gain their support.
- @others: The numerous smaller groups such as the Burghers have an important albeit small influence in Sri Lanka, surely it cant be harmful to gain their support?.
- @class: We should go beyond ethnic lines and instead, campaign among the economic classes of the nation.
- @root: We either don't want to or cannot campaign right now.

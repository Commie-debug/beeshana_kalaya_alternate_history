This is a game of alternate history.

Nevertheless, please let the author know if there are any glaring mistakes.

= Storm clouds on the horizion

Sri Lanka stands at a precipice. The UNP, under J.R. Jayewardene, has spurred growth through pro-market reforms, but soaring prices and inequality have ignited discontent. Nowhere is this anger fiercer than in the underdeveloped south, where under Rohana Wijeweera, the JVP champions revolutionary socialism, even as Sinhalese nationalism grows within its ranks.

In the Tamil-majority north and east, resentment simmers. Decades of discrimination have fueled the TULF’s secessionist movement. Yet for many Tamil youth, nonviolence isn’t enough and since 1975, militant factions have emerged, each vying for independence. For now, they fight among themselves, but their presence alone threatens to destabilize the region further.

Even within the SLFP, chaos reigns. Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s expulsion from parliament has split the party. While she and Chandrika push for democratic socialism, the nationalist faction—led by Maitripala and Anura demands closer UNP ties and embraces Sinhalese hardliners. The party holds together—for now. But as tensions rise, a split seems inevitable.

The situation is bleak, the UNP continues to strenghten its grip. There are upcoming local elections, it may be benefical to make a stand there.

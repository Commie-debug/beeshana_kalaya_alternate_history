= Kalawana By-Elections Results

Following an election petition in the Kalawana Constituency, a by-election was held to challenge the incumbent MP Abeyrathne Pilapitiya(UNP). After a contested race, Sarath Muttetuwegama(CPSL) managed to unseat Abeyrathne Pilapitiya(UNP). He has thus become the only CPSL MP in parliament since 1977.
  
- @happy: We should congratulate Sarath Muttetuwegama, perhaps this is a sign of changing attitudes in Sri Lank in favour of socialism?
- @dont_care: This election result is hardly a sign of shifting attitudes, why should we care?

Our positive attitude to the election has brought the SLFP and CPSL togheter and shifted internal party opinions.

@dont_care
on-arrival: nationalist_strength += 3; nationalist_dissent -= 3; left_dissent += 5;

Our passivity has brought further attention to the Nationalists who simply do not care about a random constituency falling to the reds.
